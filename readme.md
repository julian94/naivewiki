# Naive Wiki

A very naive way to host a wiki.  
You should probably (ABSOLUTELY) not run this server as the moment some asshole puts illegal shit on here it's your problem. I guess you could add a modicum of auth/auth to this, but that sounds like a YOU problem.

## Methods

### GET /path
Get whichever file is at /path

### POST /path
Write whatever is sent to /path
